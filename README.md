# University Project: Machine Learning
This was my project I did for my final year at university. It's a 2D platform game with machine learning AI that's capable of racing the player to the end of the level. 

This repo only contains the scripts that I wrote to create the platformer game and to train the machine learning agents.

About:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project was split into two parts; create a 2D platformer game from scratch, and build and train the machine learning agents how to play the game.

The game was created in Unity and the machine learning agents were created using the Unity Machine Learning Agents SDK.

The machine learning AI was trained by using policy gradient and reinforcement learning.
